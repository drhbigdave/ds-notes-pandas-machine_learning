- feature = synonmous with attribute, property or field;  measurable information about something; a model's inputs
In machine learning and pattern recognition, a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. Choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms in pattern recognition, classification and regression.


- feature engineering - engineering the features themselves to get a good model

- dependent variable - thing you are looking to predict

- ordinal variable - An ordinal variable is a categorical variable for which the possible values are ordered. Ordinal variables can be considered “in between” categorical and quantitative variables.

- regression - In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors')

- classification - In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.


- 2 types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised

- Supervised learning: labeled data, often historical, used to predict future
- supervised: each observation (row of data) came with one or more labels, either categorical variables (classes) or measurements (regression)


- Unsupervised learning: unlabeled data, look for- extract structure in the data
* example: segment grocery store shoppers into clusters that exhibit similar behaviors
* goal is 'representation'
* Unsupervised learning has a different goal: feature discovery
* Clustering is a common and fundamental example of unsupervised learning
* Clustering algorithms try to find meaningful groups within data


- Reinforcement learning: used for gaming, navigation, robotics, learns by trial and error which actions yield the greatest rewards
