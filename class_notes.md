- feature = synonmous with attribute, property or field;  measurable information about something; a model's inputs
In machine learning and pattern recognition, a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. Choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms in pattern recognition, classification and regression.


- feature engineering - engineering the features themselves to get a good model

- dependent variable - thing you are looking to predict

- ordinal variable - An ordinal variable is a categorical variable for which the possible values are ordered. Ordinal variables can be considered “in between” categorical and quantitative variables.

- regression - In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors')

- classification - In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.

- Supervised learning: labeled data, often historical, used to predict future
- Unsupervised learning: unlabeled data, look for structure in the data
- Reinforcement learning: used for gaming, navigation, robotics, learns by trial and error which actions yield the greatest rewards
